title: "Flashing ntrboot (NDS)"

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

Note that the flashcart will not be able to be used for its standard functions while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it (except for in the case of the Acekard 2i, which remains functional *on 3DS systems with custom firmware installed only*). There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot boot9strap installation instructions to remove it from your flashcart when you are done.

If you would like to remove the ntrboot exploit and restore your flashcart to its original state, note that you should *not* power off your NDS / NDSL until you have restored your flashcart. This is because the flashcart cannot be used to launch `.nds` files while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it, so if you exit the flasher application you will not be able to re-enter it.
{: .notice--warning}

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
