##### Section II - ntrboot

  + This step is not needed on the old 2DS (which has a sleep mode switch)
1. Power off your device

1. Place the magnet on your device to trigger the sleep sensor
  + On old 2DS, you should instead enable the sleep mode switch
1. Hold (Power) + (Start) + (Select) + (X) for several seconds, then release the buttons

1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

##### Section III - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all safety checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, force your device to power off by holding down the power button

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Delete `boot.firm` from the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.7z` to the root of your SD card
