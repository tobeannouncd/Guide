title: "Installing boot9strap (Homebrew Launcher)"
---

If you have already hacked your device before and have a EmuNAND based CFW setup, this guide deals exclusively with SysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to SysNAND. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Launching SafeB9SInstaller

1. Launch udsploit from the list of homebrew
  + You may have to scroll down to see this option
1. Once it has completed, press (Start) to exit udsploit
  + This may take several tries
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. Launch safehax from the list of homebrew
  + You may have to scroll down to see this option
  + If you get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, make sure you ran udsploit with Wireless Communication turned on
  + If you *still* get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, try using the [r19 release of safehax](https://github.com/TiniVi/safehax/releases/tag/r19)
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller
  + If you launch into the Luma3DS configuration menu instead of SafeB9SInstaller, power off your device and ensure that `safehaxpayload.bin` exists on the root of your SD card
  + If it appears that `safehaxpayload.bin` exists on the root of your SD card but you still launch into the Luma3DS configuration menu, ensure you have [enabled the option to show file extensions](file-extensions-(windows))

##### Section II - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all safety checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, press (A) to reboot your device

##### Section III - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_sys_b9s)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:    
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
